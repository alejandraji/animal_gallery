# Desmos Studio Interview Exercise

We’d like you to improve a small application that shows a gallery view of items and allows users to add new items. We’ve provided a starting point for this application that has several problems with it, both from a usability and a coding standards standpoint. We expect you’ll need to change both client and server code to accomplish this exercise.

Please take the design in whatever direction you choose and do not feel tied to the current UI. Our engineers have a lot of influence over features and design, we want to see what you come up with!

Please do not add any new dependencies to aid with UI layout or styling. We are hoping to see your HTML and CSS skills, not your ability to import a CSS Library or UI Framework

Please timebox your effort to 2 hours maximum. Please include documentation of what areas you'd spend more time on if you had it.


## Finished application must:
* Allow users to add and delete items
* Replace the float styling in the "animal-tile" class with a more modern CSS approach
* Name & description are required fields for new items
* Have item changes appear right away
* Notify users upon a successful actions
* Alert users to errors
* Indicate to users when data is loading or processing

## It would be nice if the finished application (ie: if you have time):
* Allows users to edit items
* Is mobile responsive


## Running the application

### Server

Go to the /src folder, install dependencies, and run `npm start`

### Client

Go to the /client folder, install dependencies, and run `npm start`
